# General Info:

This is a modification of WLED for use in my project based on the series "Arcane". In this modification, I added 3 more custom usermods that are used to control the individual features on the model I'm making.

## Usermod Info:

### LED Toggle

Allows you to control LEDs that aren't just LED strips. Currently, RGB leds are not supported. LEDs can be toggled on and off via an external push button. It also includes settings in the usermod settings menu.

### Startup Jingle

This plays a jingle through a passive piezoelectric buzzer on startup. Currently only 4 jingles exist. You can toggle individual jingles and adjust their chances of playing on startup. 

### Motor Control

This uses PWM signals to control a motor with the **Adafruit DRV8833 Motor Driver**. It allows you to adjust the motor speed and change the decay mode and direction. 

## Usermod Features:

### LED Toggle
- Control over 3 individual LEDs *(not including RGB LEDs)*
- Uses PWM signals to allow for smooth transitions between brightnesses
- Can control LEDs via an external button and through the WLED usermod settings menu
- Button debounce implementation
- Usermod settings:
  - Individual LED toggles to enable and disable LEDs, making them untoggleable by an external button
  - Individual LED brightness settings with 256 different brightness levels. 
  - Adjust transition time between LED brightness changes and toggles
  - Reset to defaults

### Startup Jingle
- Plays 1 of 4 jingles on startup
  - Beep *(70%)*
  - Never Gonna Give You Up *(10%)*
  - Steve's Lava Chicken *(10%)*
  - Enemy *(10%)* 
- Large tone library
- Usermod settings:
  - Toggle individual jingles
  - Change the chance of an individual jingle being played
  - Reset to defaults
  - Enable/Disable

### Motor Control
- Full control over motors
- Uses the DRV8833 motor driver
- Motor can be toggles via an external button
- Usermod settings:
  - Choose between fast and slow decay modes
  - Choose between forwards and reverse
  - Motor speed
  - Adjust transition time between motor speeds and states
  - Reset to defaults

- Settings page - configuration via the network  
- Access Point and station mode - automatic failsafe AP  
- Up to 10 LED outputs per instance
- Support for RGBW strips  
- Up to 250 user presets to save and load colors/effects easily, supports cycling through them.  
- Presets can be used to automatically execute API calls
